# Numerical-Methods
Projects for the course IF816 at CIn-UFPE.
The codes will be mainly written in python. 

Libraries used:

1- SymPy: https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html

2- NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/

3- Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/


To execute, follow these steps:

1. Clone the git hub repository to your workspace

2. Put your input in the "in.txt" file

3. Execute the command "python solver.py" in the cmd

4. If you wish to plot the solutions, uncomment the lines specified in the end of the code

OBS: if you want the output in a separete file use the command "python solver.py > out"
